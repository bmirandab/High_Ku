On the table, Apple blossom branches, A new scent,
on the wall, in the light stripe, the shadow of a flight,
On the washing line, a bird in quilibre, somewhere in Falluja,
On the weight scale, too many extra pounds, Autumn's abundance,
On the Zattere, our image in the window, tarnished,
On this dark grey day, my thoughts wander to a pair, of  blue irises,
onding , ilk day the burn, fuspers a pickle looder,
one hundred views, of the sunrise , appartment block,

winter break, I hope I'll be home, for the crocuses,
winter chill , shredded plastic, in a barbed wire fence,
winter clouds, seem to move slower too, in the cold night,
winter clouds , my gray hair, grayer,
winter darkness , Train runs last, into the tunnel,
winter day , luxury watches, affordable,
winter day , All Those nude statues, in the park,
winter depression the colour of rain in the river,,,
winter drizzle, all the passing faces look, into the cafe,
winter evening, a teacup of mint, and moon,
winter hour , foliage prunus, changes color,
winter hour , my Kiwi peeling in the direction, of clockwise,
winter in the wind, No cake for this candle lit, in memoriam,
winter in town , the stone memorial of the, God of Water,
winter moon, a tired old man, in the mirror,
winter moon, the manhole cover's warmth,the scent of the city,
Winter moon , the sudden memory, lilac perfume,
Winter moon , the sudden memory, lilac perfume,
winter morning, too many men, wearing grey suits,
winter morning , this egg and me, in the kitchen,
winter morning , frozen blueberries, my breasts so white,
winter morning , a few dewdrops on, my last rose,
winter night, too many stars, above Gaza,
winter night, hot buttered rum, fog on glasses,
winter night, the chill of moonlight, on my skin,
winter night, finding my pajama bottoms, on my wife,
Winter night, He squeaks Old Tram, on Rails,
winter or not, buttons to it, are open,
winter park , white wings and blue lights, flashing,
winter pears, eating around, the bruises,
winter rain, the confusion in her voice, all over again,
winter rain, Where the sheets she slept, grow colder,
winter rain, she places his flowers, in the second best vase,
winter rain, colder than ever, this bowl of rice,
winter rain , a flowered umbrella, at the funeral,
winter rain , the dog and I, exchange sighs,
winter rain , the man's face, of snow,
winter returns, one stubborn maple still drips, ever so slowly,
winter roses, I am tired of reading, between the lines,
winter session, in the kitchen, my cracked teacup,
winter sky, the white cat's eyes, bluer,
winter sky , it adds a little blue, over his eyes,
winter solstice, the street sweeper picks up, a glass half full,
winter solstice, passing her, bends the candle's flame,
winter solstice, the Persian cat's half, closed eyes,
winter solstice, inside the hollow tree, fire blackened,
winter solstice, candle too short, for lingering night,
winter solstice, the widow tightens, her braids,
Winter solstice, tangerine essence, in my bath water,
winter solstice, the pink tongue of a cat, lapping at snowmelt,
Winter solstice, too many things to do, this shortest of days,
winter solstice , the fog lifts from a tree, filled with ravens,
winter stars, suddenly a whiff, of perfume,
Winter storm, a drop through the window, Drop by drop,
Winter storm , my office chair, creaks a bit,
Winter storm , This last day of the year, expecting nothing more,
winter storm watch , beware of falling, stock prices,
winter sun, the flat of my hand, on the cold window,
winter sun, the slow drip drip, year of icicle,
winter sunlight, we rumpled linen, Those slow hands,
winter sunset, shadows of branches, climb the fire escape,
Winter sunset, the whistle of a, Florida bound train,
winter sunset , half of my Buddha, still in the light,
winter sunshine , the many shadows of, a small camellia,
winter sunshine , the slow growth of a stone's, shadow,
winter temptation, in the seed catalogues, perfect tomatoes,
winter trees, waiting on the silence, our breaths,
winter twilight, the warmth of his back, against mine,
winter twilight , she studies the face, in her mirror,
Winter wind , bottles collide, in the reach of the lock,
winter window, closed to the cold , purple orchid,
winter wonderland, even the burnt out car, looks beautiful,
winter's cold, dreaming, of my ex wife,
winter's end, another bite, of green curry,
winterscape , a traffic sign in the snow, points to no way,
wiping his eyes , before the lights come up, sad movie,
wiping the full moon, from a wet glossy table, with my bare hand,
wisp of clouds, the slow spiral of debt, in my espresso,
wispy clouds , the last blossom hangs, on the fireweed,
wisteria , before blooming, the end of rain,
wisteria blossoms, the faint memories, of grandmother's lace ,
with a big pencil , the price, strawberries,
with each sip, from the bottle, moonlight on my face,
with my dad, speak to learn to grow old, The smell of clematis,
withered roses , a bald woman waits , for the taxi,
Without world news, One hundred butterflies fly in the grass, this morning,
wolf call, in the distance, ice moon,
wolf moon , the dog, won't come in,
wolf moon , suddenly I see her, in a different light,
wolf moon , the sway, of her hips,
wolf prints,the gas lantern,splutters,
Wood entrance , debris earthenware toilet, under the wild roses in bloom,
wood flute music, through an open window, the crow's rasp,
wooden Buddha, with a cracked head on display, no buyers,
woodfire, flickering in the silence, corralled horses ,
woodland graffiti, a fallen branch carved, by bark beetles,
woodsmoke and fog, along the river bank, three trails meet,
wool wedding, the first moth, in the closet,
words, we've left unsaid, Indian summer,
work done, my shadow reaches, the sunlit laurels,
Work in the garden, hot sweat smell, and oregano,
Work in the hospital, the crane operator works through gestures, Very big knife,
work meeting , a paper Carambar, in my pocket base,
workers on scaffolds , paint a building, second day of a heat wave,
working late, the sound of a small brown moth, in the lampshade,
working Saturday , the small shadows of pigeons, in the fog,
world news , the pink line of a plane, an antenna to the other,
worry , the route of your nose, on glass,
writer's block , staring out the window, at snowflakes,
wrong address, the doorman wears, a diamond earing,
Xmas away from home ,52 pilot, dressed as Santa,
year end bank statement, reusing the tea bag, for a second cup,
year's end, there's a hearse, in the fast lane,
year's end, the time it takes a contrail, to dissolve,
year's end , a few tentative steps, on the river ice,
year's first hot day, East River lovers, smooch in their cars,
yellow daisy, rocked by the wind, stormy sky,
yellow moon, a glimpse of a porpoise, easing upstream ,
yellow walnut leaves, slowly appear on the lawn, early morning light,
Yellow Winter roses, mist over the garden, sound of fog horn,
yellowed envelope, holding your golden curls, spring cleaning,
yet night, alone in the kitchen, it breaks nuts,
yew harvest, deep hues fill, a redwing's hunger,
young girls in fog , the fleet movement of hands, fluffing tobacco,
young lake ice sings, a tune more ancient, than footprints,
your reflection, floating in a tea cup, too hot to drink,
zazen, that fly battering itself, against the sunny window,
zazen, Attempting to awaken, I fall asleep,
Zen garden, after each storm, a clean slate,
Zen garden, steles emerge from the sand, another dead soldier,
zen garden, rain disappears, into pebbles,
Zen garden , the shadow of the stone Buddha, changed places,
zip, o a kingfeesher, haar steekin ahint it,
zombie debt, the practised slice, of a bread knife,
